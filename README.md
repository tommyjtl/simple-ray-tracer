# Simple Ray Tracer

A very simple Ray Tracer implemented with Python.

## Features

### Implemented

- [x] Handles the input file keywords png, color, sphere, and one sun, with proper handling of sRGB gamma.
- [X] Implements the ray-sphere intersection algorithm. These algorithms are defined down to the pixel in almost all contexts, and should match the provided input files and their outputs very closely. Almost all successful submissions follow our ray-sphere intersection pseduocode closely.
- [X] Implement shadows with shadow rays, including preventing shadow acne.

### To be implemented

- [ ] Exposure control
- [ ] Multiple light sources (suns) and shadows
- [ ] Move and rotates the camera
- [ ] Fisheye and panoramic cameras
- [ ] Plane-intersection
- [ ] Triangle-intersection
- [ ] Texture mapping
- [ ] IOR and refraction
- [ ] Anti-aliasing
- [ ] DoF
- [ ] Global illumination
- [ ] BVH

## Usage

```bash
python main.py <input_file>

# Example
python main.py raytracer-files/ray-sphere.txt
```

Below is a list of implemented input files. Or run `bash test.sh` to test all of them.

```text
sphere
sun
color
overlap
behind
shadow-basic
expose1
expose2
suns
shadow-suns
```
